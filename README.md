# STATUS
This project has been abandoned; I don't plan on ever releasing an update. You may like to try one of these projects instead:

* https://github.com/soliantconsulting/SimpleFM
* https://github.com/geistinteractive/feathers-filemaker
* https://github.com/geistinteractive/sails-filemaker


## WHAT
This is the code I used to access FileMaker from CodeIgniter via the FM PHP API.

Everything in the 'sample' directory is sample code that demonstrates how the FileMaker_helper class is used. This, and in-file documentation is the only documentation available.
